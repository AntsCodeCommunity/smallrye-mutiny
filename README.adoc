== ‚ö°Ô∏è Mutiny, an Intuitive Event-Driven Reactive Programming Library for Java

https://smallrye.io/smallrye-mutiny/[Mutiny is a novel reactive programming library].

Mutiny provides a simple but powerful asynchronous development model that lets you build reactive applications.

=== üöÄ Overview

Mutiny can be used in any Java application exhibiting asynchrony.

From reactive microservices, data streaming, event processing to API gateways and network utilities, Mutiny is a great fit.

==== Event-Driven

Mutiny places events at the core of its design.
With Mutiny, you observe events, react to them, and create elegant and readable processing pipelines.

TIP: A PhD in functional programming is not required.

==== Navigable

Even with smart code completion, classes with hundred of methods are confusing.

Mutiny provides a navigable and explicit API driving you towards the operator you need.

==== Non-Blocking I/O

Mutiny is the perfect companion to tame the asynchronous nature of applications with non-blocking I/O.

Declaratively compose operations, transform data, enforce progress, recover from failures and more.

==== Quarkus and Vert.x native

Mutiny is integrated in https://quarkus.io[Quarkus] where every reactive API uses Mutiny, and https://vertx.io[Eclipse Vert.x] clients are made available using https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-reactive-utils[Mutiny bindings].

Mutiny is however an independent library that can ultimately be used in any Java application.

==== Reactive Converters Built-In

Mutiny is based on the Reactive Streams specification, and so it can be integrated with any other reactive programming library.

In addition, Mutiny offers converters to interact with other popular libraries and https://kotlinlang.org/[Kotlin].

=== üì¶  Build instructions

Mutiny is built with Apache Maven, so all you need is:

[source,bash]
----
mvn install
----

We currently support Java 8 and beyond.

Mutiny passes the https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm[Reactive Streams TCK].
